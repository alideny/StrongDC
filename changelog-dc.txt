*** WARNING *** 
 This update will change all your config files and queues, and it is 
 very probable that you won't be able to revert back to an older version
 once the update has been done!!!
 Also, finish your queue file before upgrading if you care for your
 international filenames in it - they will not be correctly converted.
*** WARNING ***

* Fixed an issue with invalid TTH inconsistencies due to files being downloaded to the same
  target filename as a previously downloaded file (.nfo's usually)
* Some memory savings for people with large queues
* Fixed a bug with autosearch repeating the same search needlessly (this should result in fewer
  autosearches, good for the hubs)

* Speed increase when loading shares with many files of the same size (thanks farcry)
* Added file hashing, turn it off in advanced settings (experimental)
* Merkle trees and tiger hashing added for TTH hash support

  all clients on the hub support it).
* Fixed bug where no/invalid file listing would be written if there was no disk space (the old one is used now 
  instead...)

* Fixed small mem leak in fav users
* Max download slots default changed to 3
* Max 3 slots more than max download slots are used for highest priority downloads

  (thanks sed)

* Some fixes so that \client will compile better under linux (thanks christer palm, he's working on
  a linux version using dc++ as base...)
* Speedups, code cleanup to GUI list handling
* New STLPort again (4.6) (a lot of the match queue crashes are probably STLPort's fault, 
  so I'm changing again, to see if the latest is better, + that I changed two lines in it)
* Fixed some bugs in the &-translation
* Can be compiled in MSVC 7.1 without stlport, make sure to undefine HAS_STLPORT in config.h
* Updated the antifrag feature to recover from crashes (thanks distiller)
* Fixed so that tab completion works with multiple [xxx] tags (thanks sed)
* More code cleanup, keep a backup of your queue handy while upgrading, queue code extensively
  rewritten to ease future changes
* Updates to the autosearch feature
* Added (well, enabled) GetZBlock, a feature that makes all transfers safer by checking CRC's
  during the transfer and if possible, compresses. This is an experimental feature, and it might
  require some extra cpu, so it can be turned off in settings, turning it off will turn it off for
  both up- and downloads. If both users have it enabled it will automatically be used. Compression
  is automatically turned off file files that don't compress well (.rar's for example), but the extra
  CRC check is still done. Safe transfers are marked by a * in the active transfers list (I'll think
  of something better later on...)
* New, very nice progress bars for the transfers window (thanks citruz)
* Multi-shade progress bars to show how much was resumed and compressed
* Added auto-grant option to favorite users (thanks saurod)
* Improvements of robustness and speed of the XML reader
* Fixed some minor Examples.xml issues ("\\" and "\t" are now correctly shown)
* Fixed a queue crash bug

  fine day perhaps it'll be configurable...)
* Added date added column to queue

 -- 0.301 2003-10-28 --
* Fixed usercommands in hub frame (kick for example)
* Other fixes to usercommands (thanks sedulus)
* Fixed reading of DCTC file lists I think (haven't tested) (DCTC of course has to be different 
  from all other clients and create file lists with multiple directories with the _same_ name 
  for no reason)
* Fixed "open folder" in finished frames
* Added new search for alternates algorithm with possibility to set search string yourself
  (thanks saurod)

* Fixed a crash on adding items to the queue
* Progress bar now has different color for selected items
* Added notification for which file was not available for downloading
* Added H: to main window status bar
* Hub developers: Added section about $Supports scheme for client-hub communication to extensions.txt that

* ADLSearch: now accepts %[nick] (see help)

 -- 0.25 2003-05-20 --
Major:

  Boyer-Moore)
* User commands now work from search as well
* Fixed a major bug where queue items without sources were not loaded from disk on restart
* Fixed slow favorites opening / excessive saving (thanks garg)
* Large speedup in file listing search (QuickSearch + unnecessary processing added earlier removed)
* Added selection size info to queue frame (same as file listing)
* Fixed some crashes when closing windows (and perhaps added some new ones...)

ADLSearch: (by Henrik Engström)
  * Keyboard shortcuts.
  * Context menu (back again).
  * Removed 'Active' column and made it a check box.
  * Unified button texts to the rest of DC++.
  * Fixed bug with multiple destination directories, some search results only ended up in the first of multiples.

Minor:
* Memory savings for users with many files in share
* Hyperthreading / multicpu users, try again and report back if it works
* Fixed %[hub] in upload log
* Some code cleanup
* Fix for buggy HTTP servers sending Content-Length with wrong case (thanks sandos)
* Added link to change log in help menu (thanks garg)
* Fixed link to faq (thanks garg)
* Fixed public hub list mouse clicks and reopening (thanks garg)
* Fixed so that "3/4 users offline" can be translated to polish
* Fixed tabbing in search frame 
* Added option for not downloading zero-byte files
* Added handling for dchub:// in main chat (opens the hub)
* Fixed a bug with strange nicks causing problems with file list opening
* Fixed a bug with orphaned file lists
* Fixed a bug with socks5 password length (thanks dwomac) 
* Double-clicking text selects the word (as in old versions, thanks garg)
* Directories are no longer returned for "at least" searches with bytes > 0 (i e directory size is assumed 0)

* Holding shift during startup (when the main window shows) will disable autoconnecting to hubs
* Fixed user description saving and updating (thanks garg)
* Large files are now moved in a separate thread to avoid losing connection while moving (if using temporary download dir)

 -- 0.242 2003-04-19 --
* Updated compile.txt with some notes on submitting patches
* Perhaps fixed the multicpu/hyperthreading issue (could someone try and report to the bug tracker?)
* Various optimizations of the socket code to regain some of the upload performance that some seem to have problems
  with (keep in mind that SFV-checking, when enabled, slows things down on the downloading end when a file is checked...)
* Fixed problems with changing active port
* Fixed favorite hub properties saving
* Added option not to send away message to bots (users that have not sent a myinfo that is...) (thanks sedulus)
* Fixed 302-moved code a bit (thanks sedulus)
* Added match queue feature to the file listing window. This will take every file in the file listing and see if there
  is any matching file in the queue (exact filename & size match). Every match will then be added to the queue as an
  extra source. Depending on your queue size and the number of files in the listing this might take some time to do...
* UI updates to ADLSearch (by Henrik Engström)

 -- 0.241 2003-04-01 --
* Made the XML parser a bit more robust against bad XML data (to avoid embarassing situations such as the last one...)
* Favorite users and hubs are now saved on edit instead of on exit.
* Added support for "302 file moved"  for hublist downloads (thanks sedulus/sandos)
* Fixed error reporting for hublist download
* Same server but different port is now properly considered a different hub (thanks sedulus)
* Last entered parameter for user commands is now remembered (%[line:...])
* VC6 projects files brought up-to-date
* Added a DLL to the installation procedure to make sure we get good debug info under older windows versions (research 
  by garg)
* Fixed attempt to access f: I think (it seems that the debug info generator tries to access f: when dc++ crashes, 
  because microsoft compiled their stuff from f:...untested, I don't have any f: =)
* Update to some confirmation dialog (thanks garg)
* Partially changed back to the 0.233 code for uploads (since the new one seems to cause upload performance problems)
* The queue is now only bolded when an file is finished.
* Added away indicator in the main status bar (thanks garg)
* Added finished uploads frame (thanks garg)
* Added finished bold disable option (thanks garg)
* Minor adjustments to the sort order
* Added anti-fragmentation feature. When downloading, it creates a file of the expected target size with unspecified
  content. If the download fails, the file is truncated to the size DC++ thinks it has downloaded, and
  resume should work fine. If DC++ crashes, you'll lose the whole downloaded part + any resumed part as well, as
  there's no way to know how much valid data there is in the file. Disabled by default.
* Added a few keyboard shortcuts here and there
* Fixed bug with SFV retrying (files will now properly be retried _once_ beforer a source is discarded)
* The maximization state of the inner windows is now remebered, default to maximized first time.

 -- 0.24 2003-03-11 --
* The splash screen is now correctly centered (we thank Vladimir Marko for this important patch =)
* Added ADLSearch, a new search filter for browsing files, submitted/made by Henrik Engström.
* Local ip handling improved, so that a per-hub ip is used if nothing is entered in the active field (good for
  people who connect to local hubs or through different network cards)
* You can now use $ and | in the chat. DC++ uses the HTML standard &#36; and &#124; to replace them...some people
  might not like this because it's different than the escape sequence used in the lock, but I prefer a standard way
  of escaping that's not limited to numbers below 999...later on, perhaps I'll add full &-escaping support so that
  people will be able to send all kinds of strange characters. The same escpace sequences are used in the description
  and email.
* Incoming connections are now handled in a completely different, more effective way (one thread less...). This could
  perhaps help with the multicpu/hyperthreading issue, but I doubt it...
* Fixed a crash-at-exit in the debug build
* Fixed a bug causing missing search results (thanks opera)
* Another go at the case insensitive string comp bug (tried with a queue file that was reported not to work so...)
* Added custom per-hub user description to favorite hubs (thanks garg)
* Some code cleanup and minor fixes
* Updated H: tag. It now looks like H:x/y/z where x, y, and z are normal, registered and op hubs respectively. It
  is updated roughly once a minute, but if you're disconnected, the count won't go down until the window is closed
  (i e hubs you're trying to reconnect to count as well, to avoid too many updates being sent to the hub). Also,
  note that there's a problem with the op count. All op's will first be counted as registered users, and then,
  when they're fully logged in the count will be updated. This is a protocol limitation and there's not much to
  do about it (although, most of the time you shouldn't notice, if the hub sends the op list fast enough...). This
  release also fixes a bug where the count was not correctly updated across all hubs.
* To avoid confusion when receiving text pasted from the chat, "- " is inserted whenever a line starts with '<' or 
  '[' in the main and private chat (so that it won't look like somebody else is writing a message)
* I think you can now use %-shortcuts in the nick when specifying user commands (%[line:] does not work tho...)
* Doubled interval between autosearches (2 minutes now, and 60 between each research of the same file), this to 
  ease the bandwidth load on busy hubs
* Favorites, users and user commands are now saved to a separate file. The old ones will still be loaded for a 
  few versions...
* Added info about current directory/selection to the file listing browser

 -- 0.233 2003-02-24 --
* Back to normal...
* Fixed a small bug with disappearing tray icon (thanks vladimir marko)
* Fixed a major bug in the case insensitive string compares resulting in 100% cpu/crashes in certain cases 
  (specially with filenames that contain international characters). This should also fix sort problems
  and perhaps some search problems as well...
* Fixed some problems with file lists not refreshing correctly when they were being downloaded at the same time.
* Added option to disable the hourly automatic share refresher
* Fixed another Finished Files crash -- now it *should* work, I actually tested it once this time...
* Fixed a "dc++ would not shutdown" bug (thanks garg)
* Fixed another thing with hub lists being unnecessarily downloaded (thanks garg)
* Fixed a bug with opening faulty .bz2 file lists (thanks who)
* Fixed a bug with whole descriptions not being visible in the settings

 -- 0.232 2003-02-14 --
* Fixed a bug when temp download directory was missing '\' in the end
* Fixed another crash when disk full bug
* Files containing $'s are no longer added to share (can't be downloaded later on...) (this is a protocol limitation)
* Changed the "download whole directory" back to the old way of working (see 0.23 notes), it turned out that i didn't
  like it and neither did anyone at the forum seem to do...maybe I'll think of something better later on...
* Fixed the move file thing (properly this time, I hope)
* Fixed edit boxes being enabled when option was not in logs&sound settings (thanks garg)
* Fixed "add shared directory" modality (thanks garg)
* Fixed finished files crash
* Added an icon for the finished downloads to the toolbar (thanks garg)
* The main icon now contains a 48x48 icon as well (thanks garg)
* I hope the owner of the picture doesn't sue me / mind =)...

 -- 0.231 2003-02-04 --
* Minor speedup in the string tokenizer (silly...)
* Fixed missing search results when searching without type (fix also provides a tiny speedup when being searched)
* Fixed a silly assertion fault in the debug build
* Fixed the single file move crash (together with "wrong file moved", same bug)
* Fixed so that a user won't be granted a slot when using a "free" slot if disconnected because of the 
  autodisconnect feature (thanks garg)
* The tab control now supports more than one row
* In the tab chevron menu, those windows that have updated (that would have been bold) now have a dot
* The download queue tab now goes bold if something about the queue has updated (download finished/added/failed/etc)
* The message edit box in the hub and pm windows now uses the font selected in the settings
* The finished files frame now goes bold when new items are finished
* Fixed some of the problems when not viewing the directory tree in the queue. There might be some bugs left tho, 
  haven't tested...

 -- 0.23 2003-01-30 --
* New release policy, I'll wait a few days with the "new version" nag, just to see if a release is ok (doesn't have
  any fatal bugs in it). If you want to be on the bleeding edge, either subscribe to the release notification on
  sourceforge or check it every now and then. The same goes for the link on http://dcplusplus.sf.net (i e the download 
  will only be available from http://www.sf.net/projects/dcplusplus in the files section).
* Removed the -Debug zip file. The debug information is now included in all public releases of DC++, this to rid
  the debug forums of crash reports with missing debug information. There are no performance penalties from having
  the debug symbols, they are loaded on demand (and if you're really deperate for disk space, you can remove the .pdb
  file). This of course makes the distribution download a bit bigger, an unfortunate side-effect...
* Fixed a bug in the uninstaller (it didn't remove DCPlusPlus.pdb if installed)
* Fixed a bug with the user commands (PM didn't work)
* Some fixes to queue moving (moving to targets that already exist in queue now adds the sources of the old file
  to the existing target instead of just ignoring them...)
* Changed the way "download whole directory" works. It now downloads the files directly to the directory you've 
  chosen, i e if you download the directory "mp3" to "x:\down" all files from "mp3" will end up in "x:\down"
  instead of "x:\down\mp3". This makes it easier to add files when somebody's changed the directory name but not the
  filenames (common with rar/ace sets). If you download to the default download directory, the directory is created 
  (i e "default\mp3" in the example). Now I only have to decide whether I like this change or not...
* Cleanup of the VC7 Project files
* The number of uploads slots is now shown as negative if it exceeds the specified number of slots (because of auto-
  open or granting). We'll see how long it takes until someone reports this as a bug...
* Added ability to set default away message (hm...perhaps this should use the last message set?)
* Redesigned the appearance dialog a bit (like the advanced options now)
* If DC++ receives "banned" during the login phase, it'll stop automatically reconnecting (n�jd nu, nev? =)
* The splash screen no longer shows on the task bar (avoids flicker when loading is fast) and is not topmost (use
  alt-esc instead of alt-tab to switch to it if you lose it...and it can't be an option because it's shown prior to
  any settings being loaded).
* Hublist is no longer loaded in the background by default when starting the application.
* Fixed some proxy connection problems for the hublist (thanks Ondrea (or is it Ondra or Ondrej? =))
* Disabled automatic opening of the hublist. You can reenable it in the settings (this is to save some 
  bandwidth on the hub list servers).
* The hublist http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/PublicHubList.config has been replaced by 
  http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/PublicHubList.config.bz2 (the same, but bzipped, sourceforge didn't like
  the load on their servers...)
* Fixed a bug when returning compressed file search results
* Changed the way string compares are done, this should fix the sorting and searching problems with different
  charsets. All string compares are now done based on the user's locale, so searching users that use a different charset
  might yield unexpected results.
* Automatic search now searches with type if possible (to ease the load on clients)
* Fixed a disk full crash
* Added "Close all disconnected hubs" to the Window menu (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)
* Added /favorite to pm window to add user as a favorite user (/fav also works) (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)
* Added /favorite to hub window to add hub to favorite hubs (/fav also works) (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)
* Added "Grant slot" to transfers right-click menu (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)
* Added "Add to favorites" to transfers right-click menu (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)
* Added "Open folder" to finished downloads frame (thanks Kenneth Skovhede)
* Performance increase in search 1: When somebody searches with a type (document, video, etc), directories that
  don't contain the specified type are not searched. If people use search types a lot, this should be a significant
  improvement. To make this work out good, keep different file types in different directories, and smaller parts of
  your share will be searched. This will work better when more people have updated their clients so that autosearch 
  uses types as well. 
* Performance increase in search 2: Words frequently searched for are filtered out earlier in the search, so that
  only directories that contain a specific word are searched. This is based on the observation that a lot of the 
  contain either their suffix (mp3 or avi for example), or some other frequently searched words. By only searching
  directories that for sure contain one of these words, we eliminate a lot of useless searching. In this first
  implementation, the list of words is static, but later on I'll add dynamic adaption, so that it's really only the
  most frequently words that make it to the list (thanks to Vladimir Marko for idea and research, to find out more
  see his post on http://dcplusplus.sf.net/forum in Protocol Alley (perfincrease 1 is based on the same kind of thinking))
* Fixed the hourly automatic share refresher (this is done with a low priority thread)
* Highest priority downloads are now always started (even if the exceed the speed & max downloads limits), this way
  important files, file lists and small files always get downloaded...(uhm, this might have the side effect that a 
  list download might disconnect another slot if a file change for the other one occurs during the list transfer...
  if this becomes a problem, I'll look into it "later" =) (completely untested...hope it doesn't break downloading =)

 -- 0.22 2003-01-05 --
* The forums are up again! On a new address though, http://dcplusplus.sf.net/forum...
* Added nice installer. It's big because it comes with the debug info, if you just want a zip as in the old versions,
  you can find it on http://sf.net/projects/dcplusplus.
* Fixed a bug with files being added to the queue without target directory. This caused quite a lot of strange
  behaviour ranging from hang at startup to empty queues and crashing deletes. Hopefully, I fixed it proper,
  but rereport the bugs if you still have problems... 

*** WARNING ***
  If you upgrade to 0.22, all old queue items that are missing a directory in the
  target file-name will be removed. Don't upgrade if your queue is precious to you, and you didn't have anything
  in the default download directory box in the settings (finish it with version 0.181
  or edit your queue.xml file and add a directory to all targets without...). (thanks fusbar for finding it)
*** WARNING ***

* Added so that only files with the same extension are visible in the download to menus (this was actually done in 0.21
  but I forgot to write it down...=)
* Fixed a bug where dc++ would stop listening to incoming connections, causing connection timeouts in active mode
* Right-click menu now works for all nicks (even outside < and >)
* Fixed width of some status bars when font size differs from mine (I think...why would anyone want to change anyway? =)
* Fixed height of edit controls when font size differs from mine
* Added the hub the user was last connected to to the finished downloads.
* Added hub to the logging (see readme for available parameters)
* Fixed a bug in speed calculation in the finished downloads frame (for resumed downloads)
* Last known hub is now shown in pm window when user goes offline
* Progress bars can now be disabled in the advanced settings
* Added user-customizable right-click menu commands to the hub windows (to send commands to hub bots)
* Advanced settings dialog remade a bit
* Fixed missing default setting for default download directory, making a lot of queue items miss a target directory =)
* Fixed case sensitivity in search right-click menu
* Fixed crash when opening file lists
* Added on-the-fly SFV checking, enable it in the advanced settings. Failed files are removed and requeued.
* Added sfv parameter to the logging (for full list, see readme.txt) and finished files frame
* Fixed startup crash when settings file was incorrectly saved (unfortunately, this makes you lose your settings tho)
* Fixed vc6 project file (zlib wasn't in the dependencies...come on guys, this much you should be able to figure out)
* If you're translating and find any untranslated string or have problems because something can't be done in your
  language (strange plurals?), add it to the bug report...(settings excluded)

 -- 0.211 2002-12-26 --
* Oops, forgot to remove the transfer slowdown code when I was testing the progress bars...=)

 -- 0.21 2002-12-26 --
* Some DLLs are now delay loaded, speeding up startup and initial memory usage a tiny little bit
* Fixed so that the default copy-menu appears when rightclicking outside a nickname in the hub chat
* Added "copy nickname to clipboard" to the hub chat right click menu
* Fixed a directory searching bug (no directory search results when hubname contained a space...*sigh*) (thanks xeroc)
* Fixed returning of own search results (oops, some debug code left...)
* More work on the queue internals (should hopefully fix the bug when an item is reported as running even though it's
  not)
* Fixed some issues with 0-byte files in the queue (an unnecessary disconnection occurred)
* More work on the queue window; File lists now have a separate folder, fixed viewing of right-click menus so that
  they only show the commands that actually work depending on selection count.
* Fixed / Improved the sorting of the transfer status. It is now always sorted as running downloads - 
  connecting downloads - uploads (unless you flip the sort order...doh!)
* Added beautiful progress bars to the transfers area (hej ullis =)
* Added exact byte size to the search window
* Fixed a bug with directory downloading from other dc++ users (that use the .bz filelist)
* Incomplete file lists are now deleted on failure.
* Fixed the socks resolve setting bug (somebody will have to try the DNS resolution itself though...can't do)
* Added "no-tree-mode" to the queue. The queue window then shows the full list of queueitems (if possible,
  the number of items it can show depends on your operating system)
* The search window now uses non-colored icons (system or dc++), I didn't like the coloring anyway, will think
  of something better later on...
* Some minor changes to the settings dialogs...preparing for making translation possible...
* Fixed port changing bug (DC++ would still listen to the old port until restarted)
* Added debug-build-type error reporting to the release builds as well. Now, if supported by the OS, dc++ will emit
  a useful bug report whenever it crashes. If you have a lot of problems with dc++ crashing, you should download
  the debug information from www.sourceforge.net/projects/dcplusplus, and then, when reporting the bug, include
  the generated "extenedinfo.txt" file. Do not report the crash unless you have this file and have downloaded the 
  debug information file.
  The extended tracing code is in part written by Zoltan Csizmadia (zoltan_csizmadia@yahoo.com), found it on 
  some web site. (
* Added moving of files in the queue (experimental)
* Fixed bug when a '\' was not added to the temp downloads directory
* Right-click menu works for joins and parts as well now (changed the format of the join/part message =)
* Fixed a lockup bug (transfer speeds would not update among other things...)

 -- 0.20 2002-12-06 --
* Collective thanks to all who have donated $$$ to me, I didn't think people would do it, but they
  actually have, amounts ranging from $1 to $200...keep 'em coming =) (keep in mind tho that paypal steals 30 cents
  and some percentage (4 i think) from me when you pay with a credit card). Oh, I think you can also donate in 
  � (euros) now, which is, of course, my preferred currency =)
* The forum and lichlord.org are currently down for maintenance, and the owner is waiting for new network equipment. 
  I would open an alternative forum if I could get the old posts, but because all network connections to the server are      
  broken it's difficult to get the old posts out of it for the moment (physical access to the server is somewhat 
  limited). For the most desperate ones, I opened a new conference on sourceforge (where the old forums were) that
  you can use, or if you feel like it, try one of the forums that people have put up on their own (I won't read
  them though, don't have time). Anyway, lichlord should be up soon I hope...
* This release is completely untested (more or less, i'm in the third world (italy...amazing that this country made
  it to the G7, and is still actually there...)), and is most problably not very stable. If it crashes, I don't
  want to know about it unless you're using the debug version (that most probably doesn't work with w98), that
  generates an exceptioninfo.txt file. If you report a crash bug ("unhandled exception"), make sure you include
  this file in the report, otherwise it's a waste of your time writing and my time deleting. I do not recommend
  this version for those who are comfortable with 0.181...
* I've decided to clear the bug and feature request forum of all posts, regardless of whether they have been 
  fixed/implemented or not, because of the ridiculous amount of duplicates. I apologize to those that made valid, new
  fresh and interesting requests, but because of all double-posting idiots, I can't keep up with things. I've tagged all
  the closed requests as "out of date", and I kindly ask the original authors to reopen their posts if they still
  consider them valid and non-duplicate. You can find them by browsing for closed posts. Also, before posting a feature
  request, check that the feature is not already implemented (by looking in the settings for instance). It is not
  exactly a sign of intelligence to suggest features that already exist...and there seems to be an alarming number of
  stupid people out there...
* The CVS is not up to date (because of the retarded firewall at my school...)
* Clicking on a users name with ctrl pressed opens a pm window (thanks opera)
* Clicking on a users name with shift downloads the users file list (thanks opera)
* Right-clicking on a name in the chat will bring up the user menu (thanks opera)
* Fixed a bug in the startup procedure resulting in a crash sometimes
* Fixed bug that window size was set to 0 when dc++ was turned of while being minimized, resulting in "missing
  dc++ window" on startup
* Added socks5 support (more or less...no gssapi support), works like passive mode. M:5 means socks5 in the <++ tag.
  (No, I won't be adding socks4 as it doesn't support UDP forwarding)
* Myinfo is now sent out roughly every 1-2 minutes if something has changed hub-count-wise (was 10-20 min before)
* Added directory downloading (from the search window, unfinished, not sure if it works, experimental,
  kids, don't do it at home, dangerous...)
* Fixed some random bugs and very uncommon memory leaks
* Fixed the ordering in the right-click menus so that "browse" and recent dirs appear first
* Added directory (folder) searching
* .ogg and .wma are now returned when someone searches for audio files
* .txt and .nfo are now returned when someone searches for documents
* .divx is now returned when someone searches for videos
* .gif and .jpg (!) are now returned when someone searches for pictures (oops, must have missed them 
  when reverse engineering the original .exe...=)
* Note; the extended search results only work if the client being searched is a new dc++...
* Improved XML handling (much less memory used on queue load)
* Speeded up queue save a lot, shouldn't take any notable amount of memory either (for those with large 
  (10000+ files) queues), although if you have a queue that large you should perhaps consider your queuing
  strategy...
* Added total bytes and average speed to finished downloads window
* A random free port between 1025 and 32000 is now used in active mode, unless a port specifically has been set. This
  port is changed on every restart to avoid problems with networks where traffic on certain ports is limited or
  banned. If you have a firewall that requires a certain port to be used (incoming traffic), go to the settings 
  and set it (your best pick is a random one in the above noted range) (setting not kept from previous version).
  DC++ requires that both TCP and UDP data can reach the client on this port. To find out the ip/port currently 
  in use, type /connection in a hub window. 
* Failed downloads are now not put at the beginning to avoid having partial unfinished downloads
* The queue window now has a tree instead of a list to the left
* Added a common controls version check to rid the support forum of (at least some of the) stupid questions
* Spaces are now trimmed from most ip addresses
* Added O: in the <++ tag, it means that the user is using the speedautoopen slot feature, and the number is the kb/s 
  setting. IMHO this is a much better way of measuring the whole slots thing, and in future releases S: may become 
  optional if the min upload speed feature is turned on (a good topic for the dc++ forums...). Uhm, in other words,
  if the current total upload speed of a user is lower than the number after O:, dc++ will automatically open another
  slot. 
* Some internal changes in the queue handling (might cause trouble, untested)
* The notepad content is now saved in a file called "Notepad.txt" in the dc++ main directory instead of the xml file
* Fixed the file search and made it search a bit more accoring to the sort order
* Fixed so that the same string won't be added to the recent searches list
* Queue is now indexed by a map instead of a hash resulting in slightly more cpu use (if you have a huge queue)
  but queue is ordered accoring to filename to avoid partially downloaded directories (when saved, queue is now sorted
  by target location and will be downloaded in that order when reloaded from disk...)
* Fixed so that focus is correctly set to the message input edit box in the hub chat window when changing back to dc++
* Recreates filelisting if it's missing on request from another user (if it's been deleted that is...). This effectively
  stops the "delete filelist"-cheat.
* Added automatic disconnection of uploads if a user leaves the hub. This is a somewhat controversial feature
  that disconnects any uploads to a user if the user leaves the hub (or is kicked...). If an upload is cancelled
  in this way, a free slot is granted to the user being kicked, in case that the user was unwillingly disconnected
  from the hub and returns within 10 minutes. This effectively prevents the "jump into hub, start a bunch of downloads,
  and exit the hub"-cheat, without the cheater being able to do anything about it. It is off by default, turn on in
  the settings.
* Alt-S sends a message in the chats
* The PM window now correctly shows when a user goes on/offline and doesn't send the message if the user is offline
  (so that you don't lose it from the edit box)

 -- 0.181 2002-08-12 --
* Fixed a nick changing bug
* Fixed some vc6 project build settings
* Fixed some minor vc6 compatibility issues
* Fixed some issues with invalid filenames (names containing invalid characters, should also fix
  the file downloaded but missing from the download directory error) (thanks Kyrre Aalerud)
* Added so that the user name appears at top level of the directory tree in the browse file list window
  so that directory totals for the top directories can be seen, untested, might cause problems but shouldn't...
* Main window state (maximized and so on) and size are saved on exit (and restored I think =)
* Kick messages are now correctly filtered (even when status line in chat setting is on)
* Fixed an issue with very long path names (win9x can't handle path names longer than 260 chars), 
  these will now generate an error
* Fixed the speed display of very fast transfers (>4 mb/s)
* Fixed a bug where a bad file list could cause dc++ to crash
* Fixed the loading of list view column orders
* Added so that doubleclicking on usernames in the main chat (<nick>) will select the user in the user list
* Added so that doubleclicking words starting with http://, www. and ftp:// will open the link
* Fixed a bug with bad hublist server names (empty ones, not starting with http://...)
* Added WM_ENDSESSION handling so that the queue and settings are saved when shutting down the computer
* Added auto-away on minimize option
* Fixed restoring window to maximized state after minimizing to tray
* Added a "small send buffer" option that should help users that are having download problems when others leech
  from them...basically, this makes the outgoing packet size smaller (1k instead of 16k), leaving more bandwidth
  for acks to flow through...it also makes sending less efficient, specially for high bandwidth users, so don't
  turn it on unless you have to...hard disk reading performance will be worse as well with this option enabled...
* Added paypal-donate menu option to help

 -- 0.18 2002-07-01 --
* Added a finished downloads window
* Added temporary download directory option
* Added support for dchub://hubip:port and dchub://hubip:port/nick (will download that users filelist) (partially
  by Luca Rota, thanks) (completely untested)
* Sort by slots in search is now secondarily sorted by open slots
* Fixed sort by priority in queue window
* Fixed "don't remove dupes" option
* Improved performance a bit when there were a lot of "no free download slots"
* Fixed missing join messages
* Shift-enter in hub send message instead of adding a newline to the text (use ctrl-enter for newlines)
  (because a lot of people can't type properly and keep holding shift when pressing enter...I hear old (60+) 
  people often do this...=)
* More changes to the autosearch, it should now be more random and therefore yield better results...
* Old download queues (pre 0.174) are no longer loaded
* Added better error handling on failed downloads
* Added a column to the queue window that shows which sources have failed and why
* Major changes in the connection queue handling for better stability in the future
* Added doxygen configuration file. To generate a very nice overview of the dc++ sources
  download doxygen (Www.doxygen.org) and graphviz (search google), then check doxyfile
  for the proper paths, and then type start doxygen in the project directory
* Removed sources are no longed automatically readded by the autosearch feature
* Added option to readd a removed/bad source from the queue window
* Added option to remove a user from all queued downloads from the transfer window

 -- 0.177 2002-06-07 --
* Improved performance on "File not available" (connection / slot is now kept)
* Remove source on "File Not Available" is no longer an option. Don't ask why.
* Changed the queue back to the old behaviour, that files are downloaded in the order they're added (to avoid
  having all the smallest files of multiple unfinished directories)
* Fixed some queue random crash bugs
* Fixed the wrong transfer icon bug (I think...)
* Improved overall queue performance (again...=)
* Fixed a small bug that caused some unnecessary traffic to the hub (nmdc works this way, every time a user logs
  on, his info is requested from the hub, but this request is unnecessary as the info is sent out automatically 
  to all users, in nmhub v1.0.25 at least...complain if I'm wrong...)
* Fixed the long shutdown time when a _very_ slow transfer was in progress
* Added some other minor bandwidth saving features (only the users that need to be updated are updated when
  reviewing the user list after having closed it for a while)
* More potential connection timeout fixed (go, farcry, go!)
* Fixed some minor client-client protocol issues
* Fixed some more faulty "user offline" errors
* Made autosearch more effective (much less hub bandwidth usage...)
* Added a tiny splash sceen (no gfx, just text...)
* Added a search hit counter to the search spy
* Fixed a small redrawing bug in the tabs at the bottom
* Fixed the sort by slots in search results
* Fixed the slow upload speeds I think...at least it should be a bit better...
* Switched to vc.net...we'll see if it's any good...

 -- 0.176 2002-05-26 --
* Various optimizations of search handling and list sorting for better perfomance
* Fixed a small bug in the search frame
* Made "Full row select" default
* Fixed some serious random crash bugs
* Fixed a w95/98 bug that sometimes caused text not to be displayed
* Fixed some socket issues with worthless tcp implementations (read: win95/98/me) that don't provide a decent buffer
* Worked some more on the socket handling in general
* Fixed a crash when trying to use an invalid %[...] log message
* Fixed some issues with online users being reported as offline
* Added option to disable the user listing. This saves _a lot_ of CPU, memory and bandwidth for both user and hub
  (Note; this also disables hub share and user totals, as well as connection type in the search)
* Fixed some issues with reloading user lists
* Added so that autogranting upload slots is done with a minimum 30 second delay (to avoid slot races where everyone
  gets a slot before the average upload has adjusted itself...)
* Limited description length to 35 characters (excluding the <++ tag...)
* Changed so that second "/away <msg>" updates the away message instead of disabling away mode. "/away"
  without message still enables default msg first time and disables away mode second...
* Fixed so that only one connection / hub is opened (even when being redirected...)
* Fixed a connection timeout bug (thanks farcry)
* Fixed the update speed of a few lists (thanks farcry)

 -- 0.175 2002-05-18 --
* Fixed a 100% cpu bug (thanks zc...stoopid nmdc hub, sending strange things...)
* Fixed dupe search filter
* Fixed bad total transfers info (you have to edit/remove dcplusplus.xml to make it display correct values
  if 0.174 got it wrong)

 -- 0.174 2002-05-17 --
* Fixed a tray icon bug (thanks andreas kronquist)
* Fixed a minor search results bug (thanks andreas kronquist)
* Fixed a redirection bug
* Changed so that the average speed is calculated as a running average over the last 30 seconds (instead of
  the whole transfer time...the value in the log file is still a whole file average)
* Added some advanced logging options (log format now customizable)
* Found a bug in the msvc7 optimizer...after a small workaround, my vc7-compiled build seems quite stable
* Search spammers are now ignored for 2 full minutes before they're given responses again
* Fixed so that multiple search results from the same user are not shown
* Fixed a few case (in)sensistivity issues
* Huge performance increase on large queues with many sources / download
* Changed the order of downloads, smaller files with equal priority are now downloaded first
* Added two more priorities
* Tray icon is now redisplayed if explorer crashes
* Queue is now saved to a separate file, and updated 6 times as often (old queue will still be loaded in 
  this version)
* Fixed some minor hublist bugs
* Fixed unknown error 0x0 (I think...)
* Fixed min speed autogrant slot (was counting bytes instead of kilobytes...=)
* Fixed hidden directory sharing (not sharing...)
* Added a few icons to the search list
* Added some all time stats to the about window
* Fixed some searching issues
* Added quick links to files of the same size when selecting multiple files with same size in 
  the search (thanks patbateman)
* Added right-click menu to the directory bar in the download queue
* Fixed a crash when closing dc++
* Added support for dns names in the ip field in the active mode settings (untested)
* Users with same nick but on different hubs are no longer added to the queue
* Added an icon for the download queue (thanks zc), more icons to come

 -- 0.173 2002-04-29 --
* Fixed some minor debug mode bugs
* Fixed some vc7 compatibility issues, but some initial experiments show that there are stability problems
  when compiling with optimization on..._STL::list seems to generate a lot of crashes...
* Fixed win95 missing explorer icons bug (?)
* Fixed the <16kb and file list extra slots bug
* Added some stuff to the search spy (useless features are the best...=)
* Fixed some hub counter issues, and updated the counter so that it only counts hubs that you've logged in to
  at least once (this should lead to a more stable hub count, especially when connecting the first time...)
* Fixed automatic redirect following
* Improved user list performance and fixed a few user list bugs
* Fixed various user and share counting bugs
* Added file searching to directory listings
* Improved the autosearch algorithm a little bit
* Fixed some issues with autoconnecting to favorite hubs
* Changed the way rollback works, it is now more tightly integrated with write buffer size. Write buffer
  size will now be used as a cutoff, so that the last <writebuffersize> bytes will be removed and then
  <rollbacksize> bytes will be compared to see if it's the same file. Recommended values for write buffer
  is 64kb or your hard disk cluster size (Low-speed connectees might wish to use a lower buffer, as it
  this many bytes are redownloaded if the file has to be resumed). If you set write buffering to 0 the old 
  (pre-writebuffering) routines will be used which are still considered safer (when ++ crashes...). 
  Recommended rollback is 1024 bytes, or 4096 if you want to be extra safe.
* Fixed search for alternates bug
* Fixed so that dupe searches are not added to the drop-down box
* Fixed some right-click bugs in the tab at the bottom
* Fixed tab click minimization bug when window was maximized
* Added minimize all windows (thanks Anton M)
* Improved viewing performance of most list views (less unneccesary sorting)
* Fixed bzip2 list file opening
* Disabled connecting to oneself. Use "open file list" to see what your share looks like!
* Added so that op:s always can download the file list (regardless of open slots)

 -- 0.172 2002-04-28 --
* Changed so that only bz-lists can be downloaded using the extra slot (since they're smaller...)
* Fixed size column in download queue
* Added last known hub viewing for users that are offline (not saved between dc++ sessions, this would take too many resources...)
* Added /-commands to pm windows as well (most of them anyway...)
* Added /grant to pm window
* Added /close to close a window
* Added a very short /help message
* Added latest version to about dialog box
* Fixed windows maximization state change
* Added an option to use system icons when browsing files
* Added support for bzip2-compressed hub list downloading (also, the full hub list will only be available in bzip2 format to
  ease the load on the dc++ list server)
* Added some info to the tooltip when dc++ is minimized to the tray (stats are for transfers only, hub traffic is not counted in...)
* Changed the slots info at the bottom to show free slots instead of taken (to avoid confusion when viewing the search results...)
* Added deleting from search results window (use the delete button on the keyboard...)
* Added option not to popup a new window for pm:s (message is shown in main chat instead unless there's already a pm window open)
* Added opening of previously downloaded user file lists menu option
* Fixed some minor UI issues
* Set default sorting to nick in the users list
* Fixed a bug that caused some temporary files not to be deleted
* Increased number of search results returned when searching in active mode to 10 (instead of 5...10 is much better as you can search
  for 10 disks at a time in a rar/ace-set), passive mode is still 5
* Added option to automatically open an extra slot if current upload speed is less than a certain kb/sec
* When sorting users by nick, op's are now put on top/bottom (ascending/descending)
* Added automatic reindexing of file list every now and then...

* Fixed sorting in the search frame
* Fixed window looks in winxp ugly mode (added manifest file kindly supplied by mike)
* Added right-click menu to the tab control
* Replaced the password dialog by a /-command in the main chat (to avoid problems with lost password dialog boxes)
* Changed so that a second "/away" disables away mode (/back is still working)
* File lists are now saved in a separate directory to avoid clutter in the main dc++ one...
* Added option to send status messages to main chat
* Added option to show joins/parts in main chat, and /showjoins command to toggle for the current hub
* Upgraded to new WTL, which should fix a lot of minor UI bugs. This should also make it possible to compile the application in VC7.
* Fixed a bug where multiple notepad frames were opened
* Source code reorganization, all UI specific code moved to a separate directory (to ease code maintenance and future unix port)
* Code cleanup, to be more compilant to the ISO C++ / C99 standard
* First test compile with gcc (note; does not mean that I'm porting to linux...this is just for fun...lotsa' errors tho...)
* Fixed a potential file corruption issue
* Fixed a bug with write buffer size = 0
* Fixed some random crashes
* Fixed a bug where logs were not written if log directory was changed and DC++ not restarted

* Improved XML loading speed a lot
* Added a chevron menu to the tab bar at the bottom that shows the missing window tabs
* Added current search string to the title of the search window
* Fixed missing/bad connection type bug
* Fixed some user handling problems (when having the same nick on multiple hubs...)
* Added a second "users" string so that translating into finnish will work ok
* Fixed a small bug that might have caused some firewalls to complain (UDP packets were sometimes being sent to port 0)
* Added abilitly to use bzip2 compressed file lists resulting in _a lot_ faster file list downloads (bzip2 compresses 2-4 times better than
  the simple huffman encoding done in nmdc. Note; this requires DC++ >0.164 in both ends and was mainly added to test the protocol extension
  scheme, but should be fairly useful for all the low bandwidth people out there...
* Added an optional annoying noise when a private chat window is opened and / or when a pm is received
* Changed the way notepad is saved, old notepad contents will disappear when you update from older versions

 -- 0.163 2002-04-04 --

* Fixed another hub counting bug (this is becoming annoying...gee, I should be sleeping...=)
* Fixed a bug where the kick message was not sent correctly

 -- 0.161 2002-03-18 --

* Fixed a resource leak that might have caused the sudden deaths (thanks carxor)
* Added saving of last kick & redirect reasons (and server...)
* Added hub name to the password dialog
* Changed default port to 1412, should improve compatibility with a lot of firewalls 
  (that only allow incoming data on port >1024)

* Did some more work on the queue managment to reduce crash frequency
* Improved file transfer perfomance a bit
* Fixed so that priorities are saved / loaded

  then checks the <rollbacksize> bytes before that for inconsistensies.
* Fixed so that the correct edit box gets the focus when switching windows
* Fixed a bug with renaming share directory names when refreshing
* Some code cleanup
* Added option to keep duplicate files in the dclist (but their sizes are not added to the file share total in any case)

* Added timestamps to private frames as well
* Added possibility to change column order and widths
* Added write buffering to reduce fragmentation when downloading multiple files
* New search window with new search options (file types, free slots)
* A first go at internationalization...many of the texts in DC++ can now be changed by loading a different language XML
* Added some information to the description field, <++ V:x,M:x,H:x,S:x> where V = client version, M = mode (a=active, p=passive)

* Fixed crash when trying to send a message to an unconnected hub
* Fixed some random crashes

* Removed some level 4 warnings when compiling
* Almost made compatible with VC++ 7.0 (You still have to change one line in the WTL to compile due to changes in ATL...)

  solve the problems people have had with unsaved settings...
* Corrected transfer list display (Offline/Online users)

  out a warning)

* Because of a design flaw in the original dc client, I had to remove the small files and dc list extra slots
  feature for original dc users, but hey, it's their loss really (there's a problem with file listings closing
  just because "no free slots" is reported as soon as they try to download)
* Fixed a private message crash
* Added automatic saves every time the download list changes (now you only have to hope it doesn't crash while saving...=)
* Added notepad (stupid feature really, what's wrong with windows' notepad?) (only visible in menu so far...)

* Made sure that the settings file is never shared (DCPlusPlus.xml)
* Reworked local ip discovery, hopefully it will work better on machines with multiple ip's...
* Made sure transfers stop when the disk is full (also added more verbose file error messages)
* Users can now download files <16kb and file lists regardless of free slots (!)

* Fixed search bug
* Hopefully fixed download bug, please report...

 -- 0.121 2002-01-15 --
* Fixed resume bug
* Fixed rollback bug
* Fixed upload slots bug
* Fixed some minor download queue bugs
* Tried a different approach to the download problems in 0.12. When implementing different user nicks on different hubs,
  I had to change some of the download code to something that I'm not sure will work with the original client,
  that's why you've had so many problems with 0.12. Please remember that this is still alpha software, and that
  I release these versions this frequently so that 1) you have the latest of the latest and 2) so that I have someone
  who does the testing for me to speed up development...anyway, keep on reporting them bugs and one day, they will be gone!!
